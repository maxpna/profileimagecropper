##The What
This is a simple android library that allows you to crop images. The main purpose is to crop profile images. The library doesn't focus on picture quality, resolution fidelity, or any other aspect of image quality preservation. This library focuses on the ease of allowing the user to select an image, and cropping out the irrelevant part to keep the relevant part to use as a profile image.

Ideal use is in applications where your user needs to select a profile image, or an avatar.
